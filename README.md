# covitrace
## Version 1.0
## App for Covid Vaccination Analysis
The covitrace is a tool designed using Python and Streamlit to analyse covid vacinnation. Current functionality includes:

* Raw vacinnation data as on date
* Vacinnations progress (global)
* Vacinnations progress (countrywise)
* Vacinnations progress (comparison)

A running version of the app can be accessed at at https://share.streamlit.io/vinthegreat84/covid/main/covitrace.py. The app may run slowly when accessing it. This is due to the hosting and should not affect functionality.

## Notes on Usage
The app can be cloned and run locally using streamlit: streamlit run covitrace.py. When doing this, ensure you have the required modules listed in the requirements file.
Scales on interactive plots can be changed by double clicking on the lower/upper limit values.
